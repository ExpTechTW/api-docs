# Seismometer (ES Series)

### Overview

The ES Series Seismometer is a high-precision seismic monitoring instrument designed with the core concept of "low cost, high sensitivity". The system employs a high-performance three-axis MEMS accelerometer as the sensing core, capable of simultaneously measuring ground acceleration changes in three directions and providing stable, high-resolution seismic waveform data. The device features a compact and lightweight design, weighing only 36.8 grams, making it easy to carry and install, and can be flexibly deployed in various settings.

The ES Series is particularly suitable for earthquake education and teaching demonstrations, academic research, seismic network construction, and seismological data analysis applications. Its design philosophy emphasizes "affordable accessibility", allowing more educational institutions and research organizations to obtain high-quality seismic observation data at reasonable costs, thereby promoting the advancement and development of seismological research.

### Features

- High-precision three-axis MEMS accelerometer capable of measuring acceleration changes in three directions.
- Connect to computer via USB Type-C serial port (UART) with output rates up to 50 SPS and 16-bit resolution.
- NTP time synchronization for millisecond-level data time accuracy.
- Ultra-low power consumption design with standby power of only 0.8 watts, suitable for long-term monitoring.
- Works seamlessly with companion software QuakeWatch-Pro, ready to use out of the box.
